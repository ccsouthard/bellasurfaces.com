## Template Creation

![Raw Granite Slab](/services/raw-granite-slab.jpg)

We will be able to provide you with a quote at the time of your visit. You can view samples of the most popular materials and get a feel for natural stone on a large scale by viewing slabs on site. We will go in detail about the various products we offer and options available, such as edge details, surface finishes, cut-outs, custom work, and we will explain the differences between types of materials and product extras. Customers can select and tag the materials they choose for their project. If we do not have it on site we will then have you make an appointment at a wholesaler so you can select the stone you want. Next, we can set up a time to come out to your house and create a template from which we will fabricate your custom surface. The slab you chose will then be delivered to us and we will fabricate and install in your home.

## Customer Service

![Soapstone Island](/services/soapstone-island.jpg)

At time of template creation, we will require a 50% deposit on the job. We also need the base cabinets to be 100% installed, and all of your appliances and sink must be on site. We need someone who can answer any questions we may have at the job site during the template. If you are not avaliable, an architect, contractor or kitchen dealer is fine. Installation timelines vary depending on your custom order. We will discuss installation schedule when we arrive to create the template.

At time of installation, we will give you all of your care and maintenance information and answer any questions you may have. We will also require final balance payment at time of installation as well. Please know that at Bella Surfaces we are always available to our customers. Even after installation, we encourage our customers to call us with any questions they may have.

## Bring your Ideas

We recommend making an appointment before visiting us but walk-ins are always welcome. Bring any cabinet doors, paint chips, or other color guides to help with your selection of materials. To help us give you an accurate quote, please bring all drawings and/or plans so we can discuss any special details of your project.
